<!-- ## 👋 New to the Community?

### What This Knowledge Base Is
This is our **collaborative documentation platform** where we capture, organize, and share the collective wisdom of our practice community. Think of it as our shared brain - a place where experiences, methods, and insights come together to help everyone improve their work.

### How It's Organized
Our knowledge base has three main sections:

- **[Practices](../practices/index.md)** - Methodologies, frameworks, and approaches that have been tested by our community
- **[Resources](../resources/index.md)** - Tools, templates, and helpful links that support our work
- **[Community](../community/index.md)** - Guidelines, contributor info, and how we organize ourselves

## 🗣️ The Discussion Connection

Much of our active collaboration happens in **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Tsunami-COP/tsunami-knowledge-base/discussions)**. This is where:

- **Questions get answered** by experienced community members
- **New ideas are proposed** and refined through conversation
- **Experiences are shared** from real projects and situations
- **Feedback is provided** on existing documentation

The discussions and documentation work together - conversations in discussions often lead to new documentation, and documentation links back to relevant discussions.
